# Typography-Site

This exercise is about practicing typography concepts.

## What you will be doing

In the `content` folder you will find a Markdown document containing mini articles with a link to a nice typography resource associated each. You are going to convert that content into a website. Work using the included HTML and CSS files.

### Example

![Mockup of finished website](img/mockup.gif)

## Tasks

### Task 1

- Create the the basic elements of the page:
    - header
    - main
        - h1
        - wrapper div
    - footer

- Add `bg.jpg` (included in the `img` directory) as a background image
- Add a translucent background color to the main element
- Add rounded corners
- Add a left border to the wrapper div
- Add styling

### Task 2

- Convert the first Section Heading from `content.md`
    - Add an h2 for the section
        - Use a new font; not the same as the h1 uses
    - Add an article element an inside it include
        - An article heading as an h3
            - Use a new, different font again
            - Use a new, different color
        - The author as a paragraph
        - The content as a paragraph
    - Add styling as in the example animation

- Continue the conversion for the rest of the sections and articles

### Task 3

- Create a nav that has internal links to each of the sections on the page
- Style each link's different states: `link`, `visited`, `active`, and `hover`

### Optional bonus task

- Check out the links! They'll take you to some pretty neat typography resources.
